# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project is a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling solution for customer churn in a telecommunications company. The primary goal is to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions, enabling the business to proactively engage them with retention strategies.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **End-to-End Workflow:** Covers the entire data science lifecycle, from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implements and compares multiple machine learning models, including `RandomForestClassifier` and `XGBoost`, to find the best performer.
- **Interactive Analysis:** The core logic is detailed in the `Customer Churn Prediction .ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, which provides step-by-step explanations and visualizations.
- **Ready for Deployment:** The project includes saved (pickled) models, encoders, and scalers, making it ready to be integrated into a web application or API.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and analysis.

## 🏁 How to Get Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 and Git installed on your system.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AliBarakat721/telco-customer-churn-prediction.git
cd telco-customer-churn-prediction
3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
Bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (on Windows )
venv\Scripts\activate
4. Install Dependencies
Install all the necessary libraries listed in requirements.txt.
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Explore the Analysis
Launch Jupyter Notebook or open the project in an IDE like VS Code to explore the Customer Churn Prediction .ipynb file.
Bash
jupyter notebook
📈 Key Results
The final model (RandomForestClassifier) achieved the following performance on the unseen test set:
Accuracy: ~78%
Recall (for "Churn=Yes"): ~67%
ROC-AUC Score: ~74%
The model demonstrates a good ability to identify two-thirds of the customers who are at risk of churning, providing a valuable tool for the business.
